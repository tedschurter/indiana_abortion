# Gather population totals 

# 20221027 update: CDC data indicates birth rate for population above age 50 is 
# extremely low. "There were 995 births to women aged 50 and over in 2020, down 
# from 1,073 in 2019, a nonsignificant decline... The number of births 
# to women in this age group has generally increased since 1997 (when 144 were 
# reported). The birth rate for women aged 50â€“54 was unchanged at 1.0 births per 
# 10,000 women in 2020. source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-17.pdf
