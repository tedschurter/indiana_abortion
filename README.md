Abortion in Indiana <br>

<br>
This repository is part of a work-in-progress analysis of [Indiana's Terminated Pregnancy Reports][1] published by the Indiana Department of Health since 2014 when, according to the department, “analysis methods and report design were modified” making comparisons to previous data invalid.<br>
<br>
Indiana's more restrictive abortion law, passed after the US Supreme Court's [ruled][2] that abortion is not a constitutionally protected right, is currently blocked by two lawsuits, the [latest][3] on the grounds that it infringes on the religious rights of Indiana residents. <br>
<br>
Though Indiana's abortion rate is 4.2 abortions per 1,000 females of childbearing age, the rate varies at the county level. Marion County, home to the state's largest city, has the highest rate at 12.2, while the rate for more than one third of all counties is one or less. <br>
